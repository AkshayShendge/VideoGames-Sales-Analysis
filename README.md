# VideoGames-Sales-Analysis
In my analysis of video games sales data from the year 1980-2020, it was found that action, sports and adventure games were the most popular genres among gamers. 
The top-selling games were Wii Sports, Grand Theft Auto and Super Mario.
These results suggest that gamers are still interested in fast-paced, immersive experiences, despite the increasing popularity of casual and mobile games.
